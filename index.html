          <h3>Scaling Course Production with New Workflows</h3>

          <div class="grid">
            <div>
              <h4>Challenge</h4>
              <p>
                Course production across 23 academic departments operated on a 30 week cycle. Builds were frequently
                delayed, with an average postponement rate of 41% between 2019 and 2023. These delays created downstream
                issues for faculty, operations, and learners.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4>Action</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Led a cross functional initiative to redesign the production cycle by introducing a 15 week schedule beginning in 2024.</li>
                <li>Partnered with HR and Legal to update contract language, including stricter deadlines and contract termination clauses for SMEs who fell behind content submission deadlines.</li>
                <li>Implemented Agile project management practices and AI powered tools to automate repetitive production tasks and improve visibility.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4>Result</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Reduced production timelines by 50% and increased productivity by 30%.</li>
                <li>Postponement rates improved from 41% in 2019 to 2023 to 21% in 2024 to 16% in 2025.</li>
                <li>Achieved a 23% decrease in course build postponements over two years since implementing the new schedule and contract framework.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4>Takeaway</h4>
              <p>
                This project highlights my ability to redesign and lead large scale content production cycles, while
                building efficient, agile systems that reduce delays, improve quality, and enable sustainable delivery
                of learning experiences at scale.

          <h3>Large Scale LMS Migration and Content Governance</h3>

          <div class="grid">
            <div>
              <h4>Challenge</h4>
              <p>
                The organization needed to migrate 3,000+ courses into a new LMS, but the new system lacked the capacity
                to track versioning of courses. This posed a serious risk of losing course histories, duplicating
                content, and departments being unable to monitor their migration progress.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4>Action</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Directed a comprehensive audit of 1,800+ online courses to establish a baseline before migration.</li>
                <li>Created a SharePoint site to track each department’s migration status, giving stakeholders real time visibility into their courses.</li>
                <li>Designed a custom version tracking system to solve the LMS’s lack of built in versioning, ensuring continuity and consistency across migrated content.</li>
                <li>Coordinated cross department collaboration with IT, faculty, and compliance teams to align on standards and migration processes.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4>Result</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Successfully migrated all 3,000+ courses into the new LMS on time.</li>
                <li>Ensured no courses were lost or forgotten during the migration process.</li>
                <li>Each department gained clear visibility into the status of its course migrations.</li>
                <li>Maintained consistent version numbers throughout the migration, solving a major gap in the new system.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4>Takeaway</h4>
              <p>
                This initiative demonstrates my skill in orchestrating complex cross functional content migrations while
                creating governance and tracking systems that ensure quality, consistency, and global visibility.

          <h3>Digitizing Contracts and Building a Scalable Tracking System</h3>

          <div class="grid">
            <div>
              <h4>Challenge</h4>
              <p>
                Contract management for 200+ annual subject matter experts was fragmented across departments. Paper
                based agreements, over 4,000 records, were difficult to track and non compliant. There was no central
                system for contract management or build history. Leadership lacked visibility into key metrics for
                forecasting budgets and allocating resources.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4>Action</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Digitized 4,000+ existing contracts and built a centralized SharePoint site to house all contract and course build data.</li>
                <li>Designed a custom recall and version tracking system, addressing the absence of built in versioning within the LMS.</li>
                <li>Established a master list of all course builds and contracts, then created department specific lists linked through Power Automate flows that updated automatically whenever changes were made to the main list.</li>
                <li>Partnered with HR and Legal to ensure compliance by integrating contract deadlines, status tracking, and termination clauses directly into the system.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4>Result</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Created a single source of truth for six years of historical and current course build and contract data.</li>
                <li>Enabled leadership and departments to track builds per cycle, SME frequency, departmental output, and annual contract costs with clarity.</li>
                <li>Improved compliance and accountability, reducing risk of contract lapses and compliance issues.</li>
                <li>Established a foundation for accurate budget forecasting and long term operational planning.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h4>Takeaway</h4>
              <p>
                This project shows how I build scalable operations and content tracking systems that strengthen
                compliance, improve transparency, and enable data informed decisions across an education ecosystem.
