            <h3>Scaling Course Production with New Workflows</h3>

            <h4>Challenge</h4>
            <p>
              Course production across 23 academic departments operated on a 30-week cycle. Builds were frequently delayed, with an average postponement rate
              of 41% between 2019-2023. These delays created downstream issues for faculty, operations, and learners.
            </p>

            <h4>Action</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Led a cross-functional initiative to redesign the production cycle by introducing a 15-week schedule beginning in 2024.</li>
              <li>Partnered with HR and Legal to update contract language, including stricter deadlines and contract termination clauses for SMEs who fell behind content submission deadlines.</li>
              <li>Implemented Agile project management practices and AI-powered tools to automate repetitive production tasks and improve visibility.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Result</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Reduced production timelines by 50% and increased productivity by 30%.</li>
              <li>Postponement rates improved dramatically: from 41% (2019–2023) → 21% (2024) → 16% (2025).</li>
              <li>Achieved a 23% decrease in course build postponements over two years since implementing the new schedule and contract framework.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Takeaway</h4>
            <p>
              This project highlights my ability to redesign and lead large-scale content production cycles, while building efficient, agile systems that reduce delays,
              improve quality, and enable sustainable delivery of learning experiences at scale.

            <h3>Large-Scale LMS Migration &amp; Content Governance</h3>

            <h4>Challenge</h4>
            <p>
              The organization needed to migrate 3,000+ courses into a new LMS, but the new system lacked the capacity to track versioning of courses.
              This posed a serious risk of losing course histories, duplicating content, and departments being unable to monitor their migration progress.
            </p>

            <h4>Action</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Directed a comprehensive audit of 1,800+ online courses to establish a baseline before migration.</li>
              <li>Created a SharePoint site to track each department’s migration status, giving stakeholders real-time visibility into their courses.</li>
              <li>Designed a custom version tracking system to solve the LMS’s lack of built-in versioning, ensuring continuity and consistency across migrated content.</li>
              <li>Coordinated cross-department collaboration with IT, faculty, and compliance teams to align on standards and migration processes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Result</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Successfully migrated all 3,000+ courses into the new LMS on time.</li>
              <li>Ensured no courses were lost or forgotten during the migration process.</li>
              <li>Each department gained clear visibility into the status of its course migrations.</li>
              <li>Maintained consistent version numbers throughout the migration, solving a major gap in the new system.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Takeaway</h4>
            <p>
              This initiative demonstrates my skill in orchestrating complex, cross-functional content migrations while creating governance and tracking systems that ensure quality,
              consistency, and global visibility.

            <h3>Digitizing Contracts &amp; Building a Scalable Tracking System</h3>

            <h4>Challenge</h4>
            <p>
              Contract management for 200+ annual subject matter experts (SMEs) was fragmented across departments. Paper-based agreements (over 4,000 records) were difficult to track,
              non-compliant, and there was no central system for contract management or build history. Leadership lacked visibility into key metrics such as how many courses were built per cycle,
              SME utilization, or annual contractor costs, making it difficult to forecast budgets and allocate resources effectively.
            </p>

            <h4>Action</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Digitized 4,000+ existing contracts and built a centralized SharePoint site to house all contract and course build data.</li>
              <li>Designed a custom recall and version tracking system, addressing the absence of built-in versioning within the LMS.</li>
              <li>Established a master list of all course builds and contracts, then created department-specific lists linked through Power Automate flows that updated automatically whenever changes were made to the main list.</li>
              <li>Partnered with HR and Legal to ensure compliance by integrating contract deadlines, status tracking, and termination clauses directly into the system.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Result</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Created a single source of truth for six years of historical and current course build and contract data.</li>
              <li>Enabled leadership and departments to track builds per cycle, SME frequency, departmental output, and annual contract costs with clarity.</li>
              <li>Significantly improved compliance and accountability, reducing risk of contract lapses and compliance issues.</li>
              <li>Established a robust foundation for accurate budget forecasting and long-term operational planning.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Takeaway</h4>
            <p>
              This project shows how I build scalable operations and content tracking systems that strengthen compliance, improve transparency across departments,
              and enable data-driven decision-making needed to support global education programs.
